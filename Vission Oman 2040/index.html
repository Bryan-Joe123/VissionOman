                Only 28 per cent of technologies that will be available to people in future are being taught to students at schools, a
                researcher in Oman has found out. In his research, Yasir Al Shuhumi of the Ministry of Education found that even the
                aspects of future tech taught to students are primarily theoretical with little practical application of actual
                technologies, which will be important elements of life for the people in the years to come.
                He also realised that IT syllabi in schools were not being updated in line with developments and global trends, as
                around the world there is a tendency to teach students about future tech, and go beyond just teaching the basics.
